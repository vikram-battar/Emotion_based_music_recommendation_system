# Emotion_based_music_recommendation_system
Face recognition technology has widely attracted attention due to its enormous application value and market potential. 
It is being implemented in various fields like: 
• Security Systems 
• Digital Video Processing 
• Interactive Computer Simulations/Designs 
• Psychology and Computer Vision 
In addition to the above-mentioned applications, it can be used in music which is a form of art. It is known to have a greater connection with a person’s emotion. It has got a unique ability to refresh mind and induce positive vibes. Relatively, there are many existing systems that could recognize facial emotions. On the other hand, there are systems that recommend music. 
• Bringing together a system which will recommend music by recognizing the mood of the user from facial emotions is the overall concept of our project. 
• Along with music recommendation our application suggests relative quotes to uplift user’s mood. 
1.2 Objective 
The main objective of this project is to recommend music and quotes to the users based on their present facial emotions. Rather than recommending music based on the previous playlist data.
